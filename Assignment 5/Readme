1]- Make sure that char_driver.c, cdriver.c and the Makefile are in the same directory in a VM.

2) Compile driver module : $ make

3) Load module : $ sudo insmod cdriver.ko NUM_DEVICES=<num_devices>

4) Test driver :
	a) Compile the userapp file : $ make app
	b) Run the userapp executable : $ sudo ./userapp <device_number>			
		where device_number is the id number of the device to be tested.   

	**   : execute the userapp with sudo command as the device files
		   in /dev/ are created in the driver with root privileges.
		   
5) Unload module : $ sudo rmmod cdriver.ko
